\abstract{%
Exoplanets have been discovered principally via the transit method, which reveals planetary radii and orbital periods. In transiting multi-planet systems, we can measure the masses of exoplanets without expensive spectroscopy by using transit timing variations. The orbit of a single transiting planet around a single star would be perfectly periodic, but if there's more than one planet in the system, the gravitational influence of each planet on each other pulls the planets slightly ahead or behind in their orbits. The apparent early or late arrival of an exoplanet transit thus transmits information about the mass of the perturbing planet. Transits can also reveal the composition of exoplanet atmospheres via transmission spectroscopy. When the planet passes in front of the host star, the planet will appear largest at wavelengths where the planet's atmosphere is opaque, and smallest at wavelengths where the atmosphere is transparent. Thus by measuring the apparent radius of the planet as a function of wavelength, we can attain a spectrum of an exoplanet's atmosphere. However, there are confounding signals generated by magnetic activity near the stellar surface which inject confounding time- and wavelength-dependent signals into the spectrophotometry of exoplanet host stars which complicate all of the aforementioned measurements. The goal of this thesis is to explore stellar magnetic activity and its impact on measurements of exoplanet properties. I used the transiting planet HAT-P-11 b to measure the sizes and latitude distribution of starspots on its active K4 dwarf host star, and find that its magnetic activity mirrors the Sun's. I measured the chromospheric activity of HAT-P-11 and compared it to stars of similar temperature and rotation period and find that it's the most active of its peers, perhaps suggestive of star-planet interaction. I directly measured starspot coverage on a sample of bright stars via TiO molecular band modeling. With ground-based photometry, I measured the transit times of TRAPPIST-1 b and c, and several Kepler host stars. I devised a technique for measuring robust exoplanet radii even in the presence of significant starspot distributions by reparameterizing the transit light curve of Mandel \& Agol (2002). I identified the possibility of detecting stellar activity cycles of nearby stars using precision astrometry. Finally, I devised a simulator for James Webb Space Telescope observations of transiting exoplanets, to explore the limits imposed by stellar magnetic activity on transit timing and transmission spectroscopy measurements.

\part{Stellar Magnetic Activity} \label{part:activity}

\section{Brief Introduction to the Magnetohydrodynamics of Starspots}

Sunspots have been observed on the Sun with the naked eye for millennia \citep{Hayakawa2017}, and with the telescope since Galileo \citep{Galilei1613}. The observation that spots are highly magnetized was first made by \citet{Hale1908}, which lead him and colleagues, notably Sir John Larmor to question ``how could a rotating body such as the Sun become a magnet?'' \citep{Larmor1919}. This question is a vexing one as it requires three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics to solve. In the following section, we will briefly outline the mechanism by which starspots arise. 

The plasma in the outer convective zones of main sequence stars is conducting and magnetized, so its dynamics are dictated by Maxwell's equations: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla \times \vec{E} &=& -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}\\
\nabla \times \vec{B} &=& \mu_0 \vec{J}\\
\vec{J}/\sigma &=& \vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}\\
\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} &=& \nabla \times \left( \vec{v} \times \vec{B} - \eta \nabla \times \vec{B} \right)
\end{eqnarray}
The last relation, known as the induction equation, determines how the magnetic field evolves in time. On the right hand side, the first term, $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$ is a source of inductance from bulk flow of the plasma, while $\eta \nabla \times \vec{B}$ is a dissipative loss term due to resistance in the plasma. Using order of magnitude characteristic velocities, convective length scales and resistivity, we find that the magnetic Reynolds number Rm:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textrm{Rm} = \frac{\textrm{induction}}{\textrm{dissipation}} = \frac{v L}{\eta}\\
v \sim 10^3\, \textrm{m s}^{-1}\\
L \sim R_\odot = 7 \times 10^8 \textrm{m}\\
\eta \sim 10^{-8} \, \Omega \textrm{m}\\
\textrm{Rm} \sim 10^{12} \gg 1
\end{eqnarray}
Thus in stars, the very high conductivity $\eta \rightarrow 0$ makes the dissipation term in the induction equation insignificant. In this regime we can apply the Alfv{\'e}n's ``frozen flux theorem'', which indicates that bulk flow of the plasma moves magnetic fields lines with it. This plays a critical role in the dynamics of plasma at the base of the convective zones in stars. 

Imagine a tube of plasma with magnetic field lines running along the length of it, at the base of the convective zone. Sun-like stars are differentially rotating -- the Sun, for instance, rotates once in 25 days at the equator, and closer to 34 days at the poles. Differential rotation of the star will stretch the plasma tube, making it longer and narrower, and since the frozen flux theorem applies, the plasma will drag the magnetic field lines with it, bringing the field lines closer together, i.e.\ amplifying the magnetic field in the flux tube. The pressure equilibrium between the plasma in the interior of the flux tube and the exterior medium is given by the plasma pressure in each region plus the magnetic pressure, $B^2/2\mu_0$, and using the ideal gas law, we can solve for the difference in density between the magnetic flux tube and its surroundings:
\begin{eqnarray}
p_{ext} + \frac{B_{ext}^2}{2\mu_0} &=& p_{int} + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}\\
P &=& \rho \frac{kT}{m} \\
\rho_{ext} - \rho_{int} &=& \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0} \frac{m}{kT}
\end{eqnarray}
We note that the term on the right hand side of the last equation is always positive for $B > 0$, and thus the magnetized plasma will have a lower density than its surroundings, causing it to become buoyant and to rise. 

In this classical picture, a portion of the rising magnetic flux tube now rises through the convective zone, where it is subject to stochastic convective turbulence and the consistent twist of the Coriolis force, before it finally rises through the photosphere. The magnetic field is very strong at the two locations where the flux tube intersects the photosphere, giving rise to two regions where the local magnetic field dominates over convection. These are called bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs), as observations of the magnetic polarity of each region show opposite polarity, known as Hale's law \citep{Hale1925} -- a natural result of a single flux tube exiting (outward field) and entering (inward field) the photosphere. The halves of the BMRs are referred to as the leading and following components (according to the direction of rotation). The twist of the Coriolis force causes BMRs to have a slight tilt with respect to a line of latitude, with the following component at higher latitudes than the leading component in the northern hemisphere (known as Joy's Law). Since the upwelling of hot plasma from convection is suppressed by the strong magnetic fields, an area just above the photosphere is evacuated, known as the Wilson depression \citep{Wilson1774}, and in regions of strong enough fields, the evacuated region cools and thus the cores of the BMRs are observed as dark sunspots.  

In summary, dark starspots are the magnetic footprints of strong magnetic fields, which originate at the base of the convective zone and rise through the photosphere due to magnetic buoyancy in differentially rotating stars. Spots often occur in pairs of opposite polarity known as bipolar magnetic regions which are slightly tilted with respect to lines of latitude.

\section{Brief Introduction to the Solar Dynamo}

In the previous section, we described the process by which a plasma tube with a magnetic field may rise through the surface and produce starspots observed in the photosphere. There is a problem lurking in our description of stellar magnetic fields -- stellar plasma is not in fact dissipationless, and in time, one might expect the bulk flows that give rise to amplified magnetic fields to decay due to resistance until fields are no longer produced. Or another challenge is the subject of how to construct a bulk flow of the plasma which remains magnetized, as it must not be axisymmetric in order to be sustained over millennia (known as Cowling's Theorem \citealt{Cowling1933}). In this section we'll briefly outline the mechanism known as the $\alpha  \Omega$ dynamo, which reproduces the observed solar magnetic activity cycle. 

Suppose we start the Sun with a strictly dipolar field, like a bar magnet. The real Sun does have a dipolar field at solar minimum. Field lines in the convective zone run along meridional lines in this initial condition -- or in other words the field is strictly poloidal. Since the Sun is differentially rotating, and the frozen flux theorem applies, the field lines near the equator are dragged ahead of the field lines near the poles. After several rotations, the originally meridional field lines have been twisted around the Sun several times, wound up like a spring at the mid-latitudes, until a significant component of the magnetic field is running along lines of latitude -- or in other words, there is a significant toroidal component of the magnetic field. The twisting of the meridional (poloidal) magnetic field lines into azimuthal (toroidal) ones due to differential rotation is known as the $\Omega$-effect. 

Now we have the magnetic field lines wrapped around the star and concentrated (amplified) at the mid-latitudes. As differential rotation continues to stretch the plasma and amplify the magnetic field, the flux tubes eventually become unstable and rise through the photosphere, producing starspots via the mechanism described in the pervious section. Some of the magnetic flux tubes have a twist imparted on them by the Coriolis effect and by convective turbulence \citep{Parker1955a, Parker1955b}, which together create loops in the twisted magnetic flux tubes. Magnetic reconnection occurs, liberating the magnetic field loops, which due to the earlier twist now contain a poloidal component. This is known as the $\alpha$-effect. 

Now the simultaneously present toroidal and poloidal field components interact with each other, causing bands of magnetic flux tubes to migrate from the mid-latitudes towards the equator, creating the observed dynamo wave of starspots that emerge first at mid-latitudes (near 30$^\circ$) and later near the equator throughout the solar activity cycle \citep{Parker1955a, Parker1955b}. It has been observed that meridional flow exists on the solar surface which flows from the equator to the poles at the surface, and via the continuity it is thought that meridional flow must also exist at the base of the convective zone from the poles to the equator. The inferred flow at the base of the convection zone is slow, about 1 m/s, which is roughly the speed needed for bulk flow of plasma to migrate from 30$^\circ$ latitude to the equator in 11 years -- causing some to speculate whether flux transport via the meridional flow is responsible for the 11 year periodicity of the solar activity cycle \citep{Hathaway2010}.

\section{Transiting exoplanets and differential photometry}

To date, the most productive exoplanet discovery and characterization method has been the transit technique. For systems where the planet appears to eclipse its host star, a temporary dip in brightness of the host star is detectable with precision photometry (cite Charbonneau). The dip in brightness is periodic and occurs once per orbit, allowing us to measure the planet's orbital period and semi-major axis via Kepler's law. The amplitude of the dip in brightness is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the planet to the star, $\Delta F/F = (R_p/R_\star)^2$, allowing us to measure the planet radius relative to the stellar radius.

In this Part, we will discuss the observations of transits of several planets, and what the transits tell us about: (1) the masses of exoplanets in Sections~\ref{sec:traptimes} and \ref{sec:koinet}; and (2) the spots of the host star in Section~\ref{sec:hatspot}.

\part{The effects of stellar activity on planet characterization}

In Part~\ref{part:activity} we discussed observations of stellar magnetic activity on a variety of stars, and in Part~\ref{part:planets} we discussed observations of transiting exoplanets and what they transmit about their masses and their host star's surfaces. In this Part, we explore the effects of stellar activity on characterization of exoplanets. In Chapter~\ref{chapter:robin} we introduce the ``self-contamination'' transit light curve parameterization that can account for bright or dark starspots which contaminate transit observations, and apply the technique to observations of ten transiting exoplanets. In Chapter~\ref{chapter:robin_trap} we apply the self-contamination technique to recent \spitzer photometry of the TRAPPIST-1 planets to look for evidence of starspot contamination. Finally in Chapter~\ref{chapter:jwst_nirspc}, we bring together our expertise on stellar activity and transiting exoplanets in order to generate simulated observations of transiting exoplanets which orbit active stars for observations with JWST/NIRSpec.
