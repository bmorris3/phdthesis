\abstract{%
The search for life in the Universe outside of the Solar System is coming into focus on the study of potentially habitable exoplanets. Exoplanets have been discovered principally via the transit method, which reveals planetary radii and orbital periods. In transiting multi-planet systems, we can measure the masses of exoplanets without expensive spectroscopy by using transit timing variations. The orbit of a single transiting planet around a single star would be perfectly periodic, but if there's more than one planet in the system, the gravitational influence of each planet on each other pulls the planets slightly ahead or behind in their orbits. The apparent early or late arrival of an exoplanet transit thus transmits information about the mass of the perturbing planet. Transits can also reveal the composition of exoplanet atmospheres via transmission spectroscopy. When the planet passes in front of the host star, the planet will appear largest at wavelengths where the planet's atmosphere is opaque, and smallest at wavelengths where the atmosphere is transparent. Thus by measuring the apparent radius of the planet as a function of wavelength, we can obtain a spectrum of an exoplanet's atmosphere. However, there are confounding signals generated by magnetic activity and variability at the stellar surface which inject confounding time- and wavelength-dependent signals into the spectrophotometry of exoplanet host stars which complicate all of the aforementioned measurements. We must understand heterogeneous stellar surfaces in order to accurately answer astrobiological questions such as: does this planet have a surface, and what might its atmosphere be composed of?

The goal of this dissertation is to explore stellar magnetic activity and variability, and their impacts on measurements of exoplanets with implications for astrobiology. I used the transiting planet HAT-P-11 b to measure the sizes and latitude distribution of starspots on its active K4 dwarf host star, and find that its magnetic activity mirrors the Sun's. I measured the chromospheric activity of HAT-P-11 and compared it to stars of similar temperature and rotation period and find that it's the most active of its peers, perhaps suggestive of star-planet interaction. I directly measured starspot coverage on a sample of bright stars via TiO molecular band modeling. I identified the possibility of detecting stellar activity cycles of nearby stars using precision astrometry. I devised a technique for measuring robust exoplanet radii even in the presence of significant starspot distributions by reparameterizing the transit light curve of Mandel \& Agol (2002). Finally, I devised a simulator for James Webb Space Telescope observations of transiting exoplanets, to explore the limits imposed by stellar magnetic activity on transit timing and transmission spectroscopy measurements for three systems with potentially habitable exoplanets.

\part{Solar Variability and Magnetic Activity} \label{part:solaractivity}

\begin{quote}
{\it Starting from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born...\\

\end{quote}

For the foreseeable future, an astronomer's only available tool for studying an exoplanet is light. It may be light that disappears from the host star during an exoplanet transit, transmitting information via the planet's silhouette. It may be starlight that has filtered through the planet's atmosphere, such as the light used in transmission spectroscopy. It might be starlight that has reflected off of the planet in the case of the secondary eclipse or direct imaging. It may even be the apparent spatial shifts in starlight indicating the presence of the planet, as in astrometric planet detection.

Each of these techniques make use of the light of the exoplanet's host star to study the properties of the exoplanet. Our reliance on stars to illuminate their exoplanets has led to the oft-repeated mantras ``one only knows as much about a planet as one knows about its host star,'' and ``know thy star, know thy planet'' (attributed to David Ciardi). If we are to have any hope of understanding the detailed properties of exoplanets, we must first thoroughly understand the light sources which make the planets visible to us. 

Stars are not pristine light sources -- they change in brightness with time, they have surface brightness variations like dark starspots or bright facular regions, and each of these surface components has different spectral properties. The deviations in brihtness are often generated by strong magnetic fields affecting the stellar plasma; these effects are grouped into the broad category of ``stellar magnetic activity''. The Sun and Sun-like stars also vary in brightness due to $p$-mode oscillations, granulation and super-granulation.

In this Part, we will explore the magnetic activity and variability on our nearest star, the Sun. The Sun is remarkable for several reasons -- it is the only star for which spatially resolved telescopic observations have been recorded for more than 400 years; it is the only star for which we have minute-cadence space-based photometric observations spanning decades; it is the only star known to host a planet with extant life. In Chapter~\ref{chap:solarbenchmark} we reconstruct the light curve of the Sun spanning 68 years of observations, showing clear signals of solar rotational modulation and the 11 year solar magnetic activity cycle. In Chapter~\ref{chap:plato} we investigate the effects of stellar oscillations and granulation on transit photometry of Sun-like stars using solar brightness observations of the Sun with a (fake) superimposed transiting exoplanet. This has applications and implications for the PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations (PLATO) mission. In Chapter~\ref{chap:astero} we devise an efficient method for producing light curves of solar-like stars that include $p$-mode oscillations, granulation and super-granulation variability based on scaled-solar relations. Taken together, the Chapters of this Part form a foundation for understanding the Sun as a star, and for understanding the types of stellar variability that we can anticipate observing on Sun-like exoplanet host stars.     

\chapter{The Solar Benchmark: Rotational Modulation of the Sun Reconstructed from Archival Sunspot Records} \label{chap:solarbenchmark}

The \kepler Mission was a spacecraft devoted to the search for exoplanets, which recorded precision photometry of 150,000 stars every 30 minutes for four years \citep{Borucki2010}. \kepler recorded the brightness variations of thousands of stars as they rotated. In \kepler's red-optical bandpass, dark starspots caused stars to periodically decrease in brightness when their most spotted hemisphere was facing \kepler, and then increase when the less spotted hemisphere faced \kepler. The amplitudes and morphologies of rotational modulation in \kepler data have revealed trends with age and spectral type \citep[e.g.][]{Basri2011,McQuillan2013,McQuillan2014,Notsu2013,Giles2017,Basri2018}. However there is one critically important benchmark star which \kepler did not observe: the Sun. 

The modern era of high cadence, space-borne solar observations began in earnest with the SOHO mission, launched in 1995, and continued with the SDO mission, launched in 2010 \citep{Domingo1995,Pesnell2012}. These spacecraft record resolved images of the surface of the Sun in pseudo-continuum light, as well as magnetograms and dopplergrams. However neither mission obtained directly analogous measurement to the disk-integrated, red-optical photometry observed on stellar targets with \kepler. This may lead one to ask: what would the rotational modulation of the Sun look like if observed with \kepler? 

To answer this question, we turn to ground-based solar observations. For more than 100 years, observers at the Mount Wilson Observatory have faithfully recorded hand-drawn sketches of the Sun's photosphere in visible light. These sketches were recorded in the base of the Mount Wilson 150 Foot Solar Tower \citep{Hale1912,vanMaanen1917}, marking the area of umbrae and penumbra, and their positions on the solar surface. In 1984, three heliophysicists took up the arduous task of digitizing the sunspot positions and areas for the purpose of measuring solar differential rotation from the motions of sunspots across the solar disk \citep{Howard1984}. In this chapter we will use their sunspot catalog to reconstruct a historical light curve of the Sun, and measure basic properties of the Sun such as its rotation period and activity cycle period using the same techniques which are applied to \kepler stars.  

This chapter was first published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society \citep{Morris2019a}, and is printed here with permission from MNRAS.

\chapter{The Stellar Variability Noise Floor for Transiting Exoplanet Photometry with PLATO} \label{chap:plato}

In the previous chapter, we devised a technique for reproducing the solar light cuerve as though it were a \kepler target. One successor to the \kepler mission which will observe thousands of Sun-like stars is the PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations (PLATO) mission \citep{Rauer2014}. PLATO is a space-based planet-search survey lasting four years with the goal of searching for Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like stars, while observing at a short cadence to measure stellar oscillations for asteroseismology. PLATO seeks to use these asteroseismic measurements of its newly-discovered exoplanet host stars to precisely characterize stellar radii, which propagates forward into precision radii of exoplanets.

The photometric signal which allows asteroseismologists to measure a star's properties is also a source of noise which limits the precision of measurements of an exoplanet's radius. In this chapter, we will measure the effects of stellar oscillations and granulation on observations of transiting exoplanets by superimposing transits of an Earth-like planet on resolved images of the Sun. This chapter has been submitted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

\chapter{Generating Stellar Light Curves with Granulation and Oscillations} \label{chap:astero}

In the Chapter~\ref{chap:plato} we found that stellar granulation and oscillations will affect precision photometry of exoplanet host stars for the PLATO mission. Stellar granulation and oscillations should occur on all planet-hosting stars, simultaneously allowing for precision measurements of stellar properties via asteroseismology while unfortunately also limiting the precision of planet radius measurements. 

PLATO is one of several missions which stands to measure planetary radii and stellar oscillations; others include the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the CHaracterizitng ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS), and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) \citep{Ricker2014,Broeg2013,Beichman2014}. In this chapter, we devise a novel technique for simulating photometry of stars with oscillations and granulation, in preparation for these missions. This technique allows for efficient computation of long-duration, short-cadence, noiseless light curves of Sun-like stars. We first reproduce the solar variability power spectrum, and then we use established asteroseismic scaling relations to generate light curves of other stars. This chapter has been submitted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 

\part{Stellar Magnetic Activity} \label{part:activity}

\begin{verse}
{\it I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars.\\}
\hfill --- Walt Whitman
\end{verse}

In the previous Part, we studied solar variability and magnetic activity, as it is the cornerstone of our understanding of stellar variability and magnetic activity. In this Part, we turn our attention to the magnetic activity of other stars. Due to the tremendous distances to even nearby stars, we need to make use of several indirect techniques to infer the presence of surface features attributed to stellar activity. 

In Chapters~\ref{chap:h11} and \ref{chap:h11sindex} we present a detailed investigation into the properties of stellar magnetic activity on the star HAT-P-11, a star with a similar rotation period to the Sun, but 20\% less massive. We find that the starspots of HAT-P-11 cluster into active latitudes like the Sun's near $\pm 15^\circ$ latitude, though the star is covered by substantially more spots than the Sun. In Chapter~\ref{chap:nephelion} we investigate whether a few Sun-like stars exhibit Sun-like magnetic activity, and find that a young G dwarf behaves like the Sun while two young K dwarfs do not. In Chapter~\ref{chap:freckles} we measure the effective temperatures, metallicities and surface gravities for 55 bright stars, and experiment with a technique for measuring the presence and extent of stellar magnetic activity via stellar spectroscopy. We discover that there is a dearth of stars with large spot coverages but inactive chromospheres. In Chapter~\ref{chap:trappist1_bright} we probe the magnetic activity of a star quite different from the Sun, the very low-mass dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. We show that the reported stellar rotation period of TRAPPIST-1 may instead be the lifetime of active regions, and that the flares of TRAPPIST-1 are correlated with the flux of the star. Finally, in Chapter~\ref{chap:gaia} we introduce a novel technique for measuring stellar activity using astrometry. This may allow us to probe the magnetic activity of the nearest stars. 

\chapter{The Active Latitudes of HAT-P-11: Evidence for a Solar-like Dynamo} \label{chap:h11}

In the Introduction we introduced the solar dynamo and activity cycle, and how magnetic activity is expressed on the solar surface in the form of sunspots. The physical mechanisms which give rise to the solar dynamo and activity cycle surely act on other Sun-like stars as well, though our ability to study the latitude- and size distributions of starspots is hindered by their great distance from the Earth. Even with the world's largest telescopes and interferometry, it is not yet possible to directly spatially resolve starspots in images of nearby dwarf stars. Thus, indirect methods must be employed.

In this chapter, we will use a transiting exoplanet to study the starspots on a star seven million times farther away from the Earth than the Sun, the K4 dwarf star HAT-P-11. The exoplanet HAT-P-11 b transits its host star in a nearly polar orbit, crossing from near the south stellar rotational pole to the north pole, across many latitudes. As the planet blocks out starlight during transit events, it passes over dark starspots. When the planet occults a quiescent region of the stellar photosphere, up to 0.3\% of the starlight is obscured by the planet. When the planet occults a dark starspot, less light goes missing than during an occultation of a bright region -- imprinting a positive flux excursion onto the transit light curve. The amplitude of the change in flux during a spot occultation is proportional to the size of the spot and the contrast of the spot relative to the mean photosphere. The timing of the spot occultation encodes the latitudes of the occulted spots. Using this technique, we can reconstruct a map of the starspots of HAT-P-11 during transit events over the four-year \kepler mission. This is the most comprehensive starspot map for a Sun-like dwarf star ever produced, and presents the best evidence for small scale field resembling a Sun-like dynamo on another dwarf star to date. 

This chapter was first published in the Astrophysical Journal \citep{Morris2017a}.

\input{stsp_hat_p_11/accepted.tex}

\chapter{The Chromospheric Activity of HAT-P-11: an Unusually Active, Planet-hosting K Dwarf} \label{chap:h11sindex}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:h11}, we opened a window into the stellar magnetic activity of the K4 dwarf HAT-P-11 using its transiting exoplanet. We found that HAT-P-11's starspots are distributed in latitude similar to sunspots, with most spots lying near $\pm15^\circ$ latitude. We found that the starspots have similar physical sizes to sunspots at solar maximum. Yet there are several questions that were left unanswered in the previous chapter. From the four years of \kepler photometry alone, it was not possible to build an analog to the solar butterfly diagram, showing the evolution of spot latitudes as a function of time; so one question that remains is -- how long is the full duration of the stellar magnetic activity cycle of HAT-P-11? 

Another unanswered question in the previous chapter is whether or not HAT-P-11 is ``normal''? In other words, for  planet-hosting stars of similar rotation periods and spectral types, is the magnetic activity of HAT-P-11 typical? We showed that the starspots of HAT-P-11 were similar sizes and distributed with latitude in a similar fashion to sunspots, and found that the typical spot coverage on HAT-P-11 was two orders of magnitude greater than the Sun's. We now ask the question: is that activity level common among similar stars? The answer to this question has important implications for exoplanet astronomy. If HAT-P-11 is typical among similar stars, then the spot distribution discovered in Chapter~\ref{chap:h11} provides us with valuable prior knowledge about the distribution of starspots on Sun-like stars.  

This chapter was first published in the Astrophysical Journal \citep{Morris2017b}.

\chapter{Are Starspots and Plages Co-Located on Active G and K Stars?} \label{chap:nephelion}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:h11} we discovered that the latitude and radius distributions of starspots on HAT-P-11 are similar to the Sun's, and in Chapter~\ref{chap:h11sindex} we found that the chromospheric activity of HAT-P-11 is somewhat elevated compared to stars of similar rotation periods and spectral types. We focused on the dark starspots in Chapter~\ref{chap:h11} rather than the bright faculae which are probably present on the star for two reasons: (1) typical faculae have smaller flux contrast in the \kepler band compared to the mean photosphere than a typical starspot; and (2) our light curve inversion software \stsp assumes circular active regions with fixed contrast, which is a better approximation for starspots than it is for regions of faculae, which are often extended and increase in contrast towards the limb of the star. 

In this chapter, we attempt to measure the presence of faculae \textit{and} starspots with observations of the Ca II H \& K emission features and with simultaneous photometric monitoring in a red-optical bandpass. The Ca II H \& K emission should be brightest when faculae are facing the observer, whereas the photosphere will appear darkest in the red-optical when the most spotted hemisphere of the star faces the observer. Simultaneously understanding the starspot and faculae distributions of active stars is important in the context of exoplanet transmission spectroscopy, where we often assume that the stellar surface beneath the transit chord of the exoplanet emits a similar spectrum to the rest of the stellar surface. If starspots or plages occupy the observer-facing hemisphere but not the transit chord of the exoplanet, for example, these unocculted stellar surface features will introduce chromatic variations to the transit depth of the exoplanet which can be mistaken for spectral features of the exoplanet's atmosphere \citep[see e.g.][]{Rackham2018}. Therefore it is critical that we understand the distribution of not only starspots but plages as well, and the relationship between their positions on stellar surfaces. 

This chapter was first published in the Astronomical Journal \citep{Morris2018g}. 

\input{nephelion/main.tex}

\chapter{Stellar Properties of Active G and K Stars: Exploring the Connection Between Starspots and Chromospheric Activity} \label{chap:freckles}

In the previous three chapters (\ref{chap:h11}-\ref{chap:nephelion}), we studied the magnetic activity of a few stars in detail, using spot occultations and rotational modulation to resolve individual starspots and to study the spatial correlation between faculae and starspots on Sun-like stars. In this chapter, we broaden our scope to study the magnetic activity of 55 nearby stars, including HAT-P-11 and the Sun. We collected high resolution spectroscopy of each star using the echelle spectrograph on the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) 3.5 m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory to measure: the effective temperatures, surface gravities and metallicities of each star; chromospheric emission from each star using Ca II H \& K; and absorption due to TiO in starspots. TiO is a molecule that forms at temperatures $\lesssim 4000$ K, thus for stars with temperatures $>4000$ K, the presence of TiO features indicates the presence of cooler starspots.

This technique for measuring starspot coverage on magnetically active stars is an attractive means of stellar surface characterization for exoplanet host stars. As we explained in the introduction to Chapter~\ref{chap:nephelion}, the presence of unocculted starspots during transmission spectroscopy observations can generate apparent trends in the transit depth as a function of wavelength, which should actually be attributed to the spectroscopic differences between the stellar surface beneath the transit chord when compared with the rest of the star. It is common practice to collect high resolution spectroscopy of exoplanet host stars upon the discovery of their exoplanets to measure the star's effective temperature and surface gravity \citep[see e.g.][]{Petigura2017,Johnson2017}, so it may be possible to do this spectroscopic search for TiO absorption to constrain starspot coverages while simultaneously characterizing the host star with the same high resolution spectrum. In this Chapter, we will assess whether $R\approx31,000$ spectra are sufficient for this task.

This chapter has been submitted for publication in the Astronomical Journal.

\chapter{Possible Bright Starspots of TRAPPIST-1} \label{chap:trappist1_bright}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:nephelion} we found that starspots and faculae are likely spatially associated with one another on the active young G star KIC 9652680, while we did not find a convincing correlation between the total flux and chromospheric emission for two mid-K stars in Praesepe, EPIC 211928486 and EPIC 211966629. Despite their range in rotation periods, these three stars are all ``Sun-like'' in that they have similar masses to the Sun, and have both convective and radiative zones, providing for the radiative-convective interface known as the tachocline that lies at the heart of the $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo paradigm (refer back to Section~\ref{sec:solardynamo} for a brief review of the solar dynamo). 

In this chapter we seek to infer the stellar surface properties of a very different star -- TRAPPIST-1 \citep{Gillon2016,Gillon2017}. TRAPPIST-1 is an M8 dwarf, and thus should be fully-convective. Lacking a radiative-convective boundary, the dynamo that powers magnetic activity on TRAPPIST-1 may be significantly different from the one that operates within the Sun. In this chapter we use two-color broadband photometry to infer the stellar surface brightness inhomogeneities of this active star. As we will discover, there is evidence that bright, hot regions occupy the stellar surface, which will contaminate transit observations of the exoplanets at optical wavelengths. The bright regions will limit our ability to characterize the potentially habitable exoplanets of TRAPPIST-1 with optical spectroscopy.  

This chapter was first published in the Astronomical Journal \citep{Morris2018c}.

\input{trappist1_bright/arxiv.tex}

\chapter{Spotting Stellar Activity Cycles with Gaia} \label{chap:gaia}

In the previous chapters, we have explored the affects of stellar activity on photometry and spectroscopy of active stars. There is a third dimension, in addition time and wavelength, that we can use to probe stellar activity -- astrometry. Stars are \textit{not} point sources, and as starspots rotate into and out of view, the astrometric centroid of a star will appear to shift slightly in response to the localized flux deficits. The astrometric precision required to measure this type of starspot-induced centroid shift is staggering, but may be within reach for the revolutionary ESA \gaia mission, as we will see in this chapter.

This chapter was first published in the Astronomical Journal \citep{Morris2018b}.

\part{The effects of stellar activity on planet characterization} \label{part:synthesis}

{\it Lo, the darting bowling orb!\\
Lo, the brother orbs around, all the clustering suns and planets,\\
All the dazzling days, all the mystic nights with dreams,\\
Pioneers! O pioneers!}
\hfill --- Walt Whitman
\end{verse}

In Part~\ref{part:activity} we discussed observations of stellar magnetic activity on a variety of stars. These investigations were crucial for setting the stage for studying the effects of stellar magnetic activity on exoplanet characterization, a topic of ever-increasing importance in the age of the James Webb Space Telescope and thirty-meter-class telescopes, which will inevitably make advances in stellar astrophysics on their way to measuring properties of exoplanets.  

In this Part, we explore the effects of stellar activity on characterization of exoplanets. In Chapter~\ref{chapter:robin} we introduce the ``self-contamination'' transit light curve parameterization that can account for bright or dark starspots which contaminate transit observations, and apply the technique to observations of ten transiting exoplanets. In Chapter~\ref{chapter:robin_trap} we apply the self-contamination technique to recent \spitzer photometry of the TRAPPIST-1 planets to look for evidence of starspot contamination. Finally in Chapter~\ref{chapter:jwst_nirspc}, we bring together our expertise on stellar activity and transiting exoplanets in order to generate simulated observations of transiting exoplanets which orbit active stars for observations with JWST/NIRSpec.  

\chapter{Robust Transiting Exoplanet Radii in the Presence of Starspots from Ingress and Egress Durations} \label{chapter:robin}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:h11} we used the transiting exoplanet HAT-P-11 to characterize the starspots that it occulted. In that chapter, we had to take extra care to measure the photometric transit depth from the \kepler photometry, because spot occultations occurred frequently, contaminating most transits towards shallower depths. In this chapter, we address this problem head-on: suppose you had a star with a dense band of starspots or a bright ring beneath the transit chord of the exoplanet? Such a surface inhomogeneity might be incorrectly interpreted as a smaller or larger planet; but we will find that the ingress and egress durations of transiting exoplanets provide an independent check on the radius of the exoplanet, which is not contaminated by starspots in the transit chord.    

This chapter was first published in the Astronomical Journal \citep{Morris2018e}.

\input{robin/main.tex}

\chapter{Robust Transiting Exoplanet Radii: Revisiting TRAPPIST-1} \label{chapter:robin_trap}

In the previous chapter we developed and applied the ``self-contamination'' technique used to analyze transit light curves of planets which occult spotted stars. The self-contamination simply modifies the \citet{Mandel2002} transit light curve equation such that the transit depth is disconnected from the ratio of planet to stellar radii, allowing the depths of transit light curves to be contaminated by the presence of starspots, bright or dark, occulted or unocculted. 

In this chapter, we apply the self-contamination technique to a star we have already visited with great interest in this dissertation: TRAPPIST-1. As we explored in Chapter~\ref{chap:trappist1_bright}, bright spots may be required to explain the \kepler and \spitzer photometry of TRAPPIST-1. Knowing the true properties of the stellar activity of TRAPPIST-1 is key to understanding the transmission spectra of its exoplanets. Thus in this chapter, we use recent \spitzer transit observations of TRAPPIST-1 b-h to probe the stellar surface inhomogeneities of TRAPPIST-1 with the self-contamination technique.

This chapter was first published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters \citep{Morris2018f}.

\chapter{The Limits of Transit Characterization with JWST/NIRSpec due to Stellar Variability: The Cases of TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-296 and Kepler-62} \label{chapter:jwst_nirspc}

In the previous Parts, we built an array of tools for understanding stellar magnetic activity, and variability due to granulation and oscillations. In the previous two chapters, we introduced and implemented a novel technique for measuring the radii of transiting exoplanets in the presence of stellar activity. In this chapter, we synthesize all of the efforts cataloged in the previous chapters towards one goal: characterizing a small sample of potentially habitable exoplanets with active host stars. 

The James Webb Space Telescope stands to revolutionize observations of transiting exoplanets, with nearly a factor of seven more photon-collecting area than the Hubble Space Telescope. Its high throughput observing modes, such as the NIRSpec detector with the Prism observing mode, promise tremendous photon fluxes enabling precision studies of transiting exoplanets. However, one major obstacle looms over the fantastic feats we hope to achieve with James Webb: the time-dependent and chromatic variations in brightness of the host stars. In this chapter, we present case studies of three systems with potentially habitable worlds, and examine the limits of exoplanet characterization imposed by their host stars.

\pagebreak
In the previous Parts, repositories of software were written to facilitate each scientific effort, all of which are available on GitHub\footnote{\url{http://github.com/bmorris3}}. In the appendices, we highlight two open source, open development coding efforts which may be of use to the broader community. In Appendix A we introduce {\tt astroplan}, an astropy-affiliated package for observation planning and scheduling in Python. In Appendix B we introduce {\tt aesop}, a Python package for analysis of echelle spectra collected with the ARC Echelle Spectrograph (ARCES) at Apache Point Observatory (APO). In Appendix C we introduce {\tt arcesetc}, a Python exposure time calculator package for the ARCES at APO.

\chapter{aesop: The ARC Echelle Spectrograph Observation Pipeline} \label{chap:aesop}

This chapter was first published in the Journal of Open Source Software in collaboration with Trevor Dorn-Wallenstein \citep{aesop}.

The ARC Echelle Spectroscopic Observation Pipeline, or {\tt aesop}, is a high resolution spectroscopy software toolkit tailored for observations from the Astrophysics Research Consortium (ARC) Echelle Spectrograph mounted on the ARC 3.5 m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory. {\tt aesop} picks up where the traditional IRAF reduction scripts leave off, offering an open development, object-oriented Pythonic analysis framework for echelle spectra.

Basic functionality of {\tt aesop} includes: (1) blaze function normalization by polynomial fits to observations of early-type stars, (2) an additional/alternative robust least-squares normalization method, (3) radial velocity measurements (or offset removals) via cross-correlation with model spectra, including barycentric radial velocity calculations, (4) concatenation of multiple echelle orders into a simple 1D spectrum, and (5) approximate flux calibration.

Some handy additional utilities include methods for download PHOENIX model spectra \citep{Husser2013}, and methods for measuring the Mount Wilson Observatory-calibrated CaII H & K ``S'' index \citep{Morris2017b}. aesop was built from the Astropy package-template, and thus includes self-building documentation and continuous integration \citep{Astropy2018}.
 
 \chapter{arcesetc: ARC Echelle Spectrograph Exposure Time Calculator}
 
The ARC Echelle Spectrograph (ARCES) Exposure Time Calculator, or {\tt arcesetc}, is a simple exposure time calculator for the ARCES instrument on the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) 3.5 m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory for stellar spectroscopy. Users can supply {\tt arcesetc} functions with the spectral type of their target star, the V band magnitude, and either: the desired exposure time in order to determine the counts and signal-to-noise ratio as a function of wavelength; or the desired signal-to-noise ratio at a given wavelength to determine the required exposure time.

We estimate the count rates for stars as a function of wavelength by fitting 15th-order polynomials to each spectral order of real observations of a star of each spectral type. These polynomial coefficients and some wavelength metadata are stored in an HDF5 archive for compactness and easy of reconstruction. Then upon calling {\tt arcesetc}, the archive is opened and the spectral order closest to the wavelength of interest is reconstructed from the polynomial coefficients, for a star of the closest available spectral type to the one requested .

At present, the 79 stellar spectral types included in the {\tt arcesetc} library span from mid F to mid M stars on the main sequence, a variety of M giants, a handful of O and B, and and a white dwarf and a Wolf-Rayet star. Contributions from the community are welcome to expand the library to include other spectral
types.

{\tt arcesetc} was built from the Astropy package-template, and thus includes self-building documentation and continuous integration \citep{Astropy2018}.
